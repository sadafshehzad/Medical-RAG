# Medical-RAG
Medical Retrieval Augmented Generation App:


•	Developed a Medical RAG (Retriever-Augmented Generation) chatbot using the Llama.cpp library, enabling inference of the quantized ‘BioMistral-7B.Q4_K_M.gguf’ LLM on a CPU machine. Built an efficient web app for the medical RAG application using FastAPI.
•	Stored document embeddings using Qdrant as the vector database, leveraging the ‘pubmedbert-base-embeddings’ model for sentence embeddings to enhance performance.
